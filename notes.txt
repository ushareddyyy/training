ReactJs:
--------
-Javascript is having libraries and frameworks.

-libraries:	-it is a collection of codes.
			-less set of rules
			-reactjs,jquery etc
-frameworks:-it is a collection of libraries
			-more set of rules
			-angular,vuejs etc

important features of ReactJs
-----------------------------
1.reactjs is a javascript libreary to build rich reusable user interface.
2*.reactjs is faster beacuse of "vertual Dom".
3*.react follows component based architecture.
4*.react folloows unidirectional data flow.
5.react follows both client side rendaring and server side rendaring
6.react was introduced by facebook in 2011 BY JORDAN WALKE.
-at 2013 react made as a open source
-react is free and platform independent

-to install ReactJs-install node js (cmd node -v);
-create npm install create-react-app --g
-npm init react-app myapp

_______

single page application:contains only one html page
-changeds happen in one tap
-there is no page refrseshing,reloading

multi page application:contains multiple html page
-changeds happen in many tap
-there is having page refrseshing,reloading

))REACT is mainly for single page application
-real dom is created automatically

))What  is  virtual dom?
--------------------------
-virtual dom is craeted explicitly
-it is a virtual presentation of UI,which is kept in the memory later synced with real dom with the help of a library called as "ReactDOM".
-the updation of real dom with virtual dom
- the entire process of updating realDOM with VDOM with the "Reconcialation"

))Diffing algorithm

JSX;
----

-Javascript and XML
-it is a javascript syntax extention used to create HTML-like markup in the react.
-Actual way to create a element in react is is by using a methos
    -React.createElement("target",{propertyname"}/null,content/children)

-JSX not part of react but it is recomended to use in react

RULES of JSX;
-------------
1.every element inrrespect of pared/unpared tag both must be closed
ex:<h1></h1>,<input/>
2.more than one JSX element is used then they must raped with one parent element

JSX expression
----------------
-it us used to call the variable,mathematical expression inside lement.
-syntax:<h1>{}</h1>

-
components
-----------
-they are files/modules which consist of js logics which can be reused
1.class based components(CBC)
2.functional based components(FBC)

1.class based components(CBC)
-------------------------------
-it is similar to js es6 class
-CBC are "statefull" componet b/c of default State object present inside the class
-syntax:-
class Person{
    constructor(name,age){
        this.age=age;
        this.name=name;
    }
}
class child extends Person{
    constructor(name,age,city){
        super(name,age);//inhert properties fom parent to child
        this.city=city;
    } 
}

SYNTAX:-
class App extends React.Component{
    render(){//responsible to print this JSX in the UI
        return(
            //JSX
        )
    }
}
export default App;

2.functional based components(FBC)
----------------------------------
-they are similar to js functions
-they are "stateless" b/c there is no State object until react v16.8
Syntax:
function App(){
    return(

    )
}export default App;

OR
 const App=()=>{
    return(

    )
 }export default App;
