JavaScript
__________

-it helps to make websites dynamically and interactive.
-used both on client side(in the browser) and serverside(node js).
-it allows the webpages to change it with out reloading the entire page
-it is a scripting languages used to write scripts to develop webpages.
-it is often used for form validations.
-it was first released by "NetScape"
-it can be implemented in the html using <script> tag.

1)Variables:
____________

-python,java
-variables are used to store data(any kind of data)
-when we use same variable name the second value of the variable will rewrite old one(second value is considered ).
-variables always starts with letters,_,$ but not numbers.
-variables can include letters,numbers,_,$.
-for all the programming languages except sql variable are case-Sensitive
-space between two variable names are not allowed

Types of variables
1)var
-re-initialization
-re-declaration

var(variable) u(identifier)="usha"(value/data);
console.log(u);=>it is a method to print the o/p in the developer console.
document.writeLn();=>it is the method to print the o/p on the UI

Coments are the ignored lined by the browser
1)html:-<!--comment to be done -->
css:-/*comment/*

Day4
____

1)Operators:

-They are special Type of Sysmbols used to perform some operations on operands.
ex:-a+b(a,b are operands ,+ is an operator)

Types of Operators:

-unary
-binary
-ternary(op1 ? op2 :op3)

1.Arithmatic Operators

   - =,+=,*=,/=

3)Relational Operators
-which are used to compare two values 
-always retuens boolean
- ==,===,!=,!==,>,>=,<,<=

differences between "==" and "==="
"==" it will check value but not data Type.
"===" it will check both values and data type
 "!=" it will check value but not data Type.
"!==" it will check both values and data type
	
4)Logical Operators
-AND(&&):when both conditions are true return true else false
-OR(&&):when any one consition is true return true else false
-NOT(!):if true returns false and viseversa

5)Decision making statements:-
-if:only if condition is true then executes
-if else:
-else if ladder
-switch
-ternary

prompt():- takes values manually

_____

Looping statements
__________________

 -to execute a  block of code repeatedly
)))for Looping:
for(Initialization,condition,updation){
	statements
}
-when the no of iterations are known
)))while
while(condition){
	statements
}
-when the no of iterations are not known
)))do while
do(){
}
while(conditions){//entry control
	statements
}
-when the no of iterations are not known

What is entry control and exit control loop:
--entry control loops are for,while.
--exit control loops are do-while.

-)minimum iteration count of for and while is "0"
-)minimum iteration count of do-while is "1"

What is the difference between breah and continue?
break:-when condition satisfy it will terminate the loop permanently
continue:-when condition satisfy it wil skip the condition

=]Function:
___________

-it is a block of code used to perform specific task
-reusability
-javaScript also code as functionalized 
-it is a non primitive data type
syntax:- function function_name(optional oparameters){//function declaration
			//statements
		}
		function_name(arguments);
		let a=10;

Types of functions:-
____________________

1)).named functions(fun which is invoked using same nMAE)
2)).anonymus function(FUNCTION WHICH DOES NOT HAVE NAME TO DECLARE NAME AND INVOKING THE NAME)
-without decalring the function name body it cant be execute
3)).function expression //csn be called multiple times
ananymus function declaration is assigned to variable and invoked withe same variable
let x=function(){
    console.log("function expression");
};
x();
4)).Immediate invoke function expression //it can call only once
once function is created it should be invoked immediately
(function(){
    console.log("IIFE");
})
();
5)).Arrow function --it is used to concise the normal function syntax
syntax:-()=>{}
-it is similar to anonymus function
let x=()=>{
    console.log("Arrow function");
};
x();
let x=_=>
    console.log("Arrow function");

x();
6.))Higher order function
-A function which accepts another function as an arguments to its parameter.
7)).Callback function
-a function that is passed as an argument to higher order function
))closure
-is a memory where functions are bundle together by giving  an accessibility to inner most function to access the variables of the outer most function.
NOTE:-
-javascript first name is live Scrip
-brendeneach
-current version of javascript is es14.
-es6-highly used till now
-es-ECMA script

RETURN STATEMENT:
__________________
-return the expression,variables or values
-also used to terminate or stop the execution
function test(a,b){
    console.log("hi");
    console.log("hhvj");//explicit return
    return a+b;
    console.log("hello");
}
The return keyword is used in programming to:
Finish the execution of a method.
Return a value from a method.
Exit a function and return a value.

Day 6:
_______

Arrays:
________

-it is non primitive data type.
-array can store multiple values within a single variable.
-collection of item/values.
-array can store homogenous values and hetrogenous values.
-)Syntax:- let arr=[];

ex:- 


map and forEach difference
--------------------------

-map:-it is used to iterate the values of the array one by one;
-it will returns new copied array ;
-foeEach:-it is used to iterate the values from the array
-it will returns "undifined"


)))methods in an array

-push(),pop(),unshift(),shift(),reverse(0,join(),concat(0))
 
)))what is an object?

-object ia an entity which is used to store the values in the form of key and value pairs;
it is an entity which is having states and behaviours.
-object is an physical entity to store an entity which is having states and behavoiurs(method);

Note:---
-javascript is a object based because dont use class + but after EC6 class is introduced in javaScripts

Systax:- let obj={};
ex:-
let obj{
	name:"sai",
	age=18
}
Day 7
_____

JSON PLACEHOLDER

JSON:-javascript object notation
-it is used to transmit the data from client to server to client.
-it is always in the form of "String"
SYNTAX:-
{
	"key":"value"
	}
-for json no need to store it inside the variable
-here both keys and values should be " " except number

-methods of json
1.JSON.stringfy();-it is used to convert javascript object to json object
2.JSON.parse();-used to convert json object into javascript object

[(((fontawesome.com -for symbols
font awesome cdn links--((paste in header ]

Day 8
______

Asynchonus in javascript
------------------------
-to perform multiple task in javascript

1.setTimeout();-it is a web application used to perform async operations at
syntax;]-setTimeout(callbackfn,)
2.setIntervel();-used to perform async operations at a certain timeout
syntax;]-setIntervel(callbackfn,timeout)
(3.promise;-it is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of an async operations
  states of promise
  1.pending state
  2.fulfilled state
  3.rejected state
syntax;]-let p = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{});
-the actual way of executing the promise is instance methods
	1.then();it is used to execute fulfilled state
	2.catch();it executes rejected state
	3.finally();it will print once the promise is settled

(4.async & await

note:-by default,javascript is synchronus.

Day 9
______

coding

Day 10
______

async:-async keyword is used to convert synchronus into Asynchonus and start to executethe promise
await:-await is used to make the function to wait until the promise complete

DOM:-
-----
document object model
-it is used to add,remove,update the content in the html document.
-it is used to manupulate the content in the html document.

-methods
---------
1.document.getElementById(""):- it is used to select or target the html elemet based on "id attribute value".
								-id attribute should be uniqe or used with one element
2.document.getElementByClassName(""):-it is used to select or target the html elemet based on "class attribute value".
								-class attribute can be used with comman name
3.document.getElementByTagName(""):-it is used to select html element based on tag names 
4.document.getElementByName(""):-it is used to select html element based on name attribute value.
---these below methods are different from above attributes
---below attributes select html methods based on css selectors
5.document.querySelector("#id"):-it selects only on elements
6.document.querySelectorAll("#.class"):-it selects on multiple elements
innerText:it is a property to manipulate plain text
innerHtml:used to add remove content with

onclick
ondblclick
onsubmit
onchange

mouse events
------------
-dynamic events from dom


Day 11
_______

dynamic creation of html element from javascript
-------------------------------------------------
-to create dynamic element we have a method called document.createElement();
-to create an attribute we have a method called setAttribute();
-to remove attribute we have a method called removeAttribute()
-any element which is created in javascript will not add directly to documents,we have
 to manually add using append file

 Day 12
 ______

 take a array of objects(employee),where each object contains properties such as empid,empname,empcompany,empsalary,empaddress
 where empaddress is further having 2 more properties of object such as empcity and emp area
 print tehase propertites in a form of a table on the UI by using javascript

Day 13
_______

 Modules
 --------
 in javascript import/exports code to another js files are Modules
 
 1)named Modules
 ---------------
 -definenly while importing should use the same name that you are defining exactly with in{}
 -you can export as many modules of code that you want.

 2)default modules
 -----------------
 -while importing can use any name that you want.You can export only one modules of code
 in one source file.You should use the default keyword while exporting.

)))))careate a signup form that contains username(!empty),
email(@,!empty),
password(should be 6) and
confirm password(same,!empty),
once you click on submit button,
a alert should be popped up on you screen "form is submitted successfully" 
if and only if all the validations are correct.
